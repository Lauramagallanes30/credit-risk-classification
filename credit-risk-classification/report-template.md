## Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to use machine learning models to determine loans as either healthy or high risk based on the borrower's financial status. By determing this, lenders can more effectively assess loan risk and make data driven decisions. 

The data set includes: 
Loan Size, interest rate, borrow income, total debt, debt to income, total debt and other features that can assist in determining financial standing. 

## Results

Healthy Loans (loan_status = 0):

Accuracy: 99%
Precision: 1.0
Recall: 99%

High-Risk Loans (loan_status = 1):

Accuracy: 99%
Precision: 85%
Recall: 94%

The model accuarately classifies both healthy loans as well as high risk loans. It shows effective and efficient predictive abilities but with areas of improvement. The company can choose to use the model for high risk loans but may want to add additional provisions for accuracy. Since it is not as effective with high risk loans as healthy loan, it can potentially put the company at finanical risk if the high risk loans data isn't as accurate as possible as they choose to follow through with providing mentioned loans. 

## Summary

The model accuarately predicts healthy loans very well as well as high risk loans although there is some indication of false postives which can be improved. It shows effective and efficient predictive abilities but with areas of improvement. The company can choose to use the model for high risk loans but may want to add additional provisions for accuracy.
